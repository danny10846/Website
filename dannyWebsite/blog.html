                <p>After a long anticipated wait I've finally decided to brush off the website so I can include it in my CV. When I originally made this website I naively included a blog section with the idea being I would document 
                    my progress on my third year project here, along with other things going on in my life. The website was unfortunately almost instantly replaced with a logbook. However, now I've got to grips with dreaded HTML and CSS
                    again, and I have finished with university, I can start to make the website look nice and pretty.

                    As of today, I am oficially employed with Siemens in their internship program. My start date isn't for another month, which leaves me with time to work on personal projects and get my data structures knowledge up to
                    snuff. I've been working on a few things but the one I want to add to this website is a particle emitter built in javascript.
